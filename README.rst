Mango to wasm compiler
===============================

Mango is a statically typed programming language that is designed to be compiled to WebAssembly.

It has a `compiler frontend`_ that does the parsing and type checking, producing IR_. This project takes that IR data and produces runnable and optimized WebAssembly code.

Status
-------------------------------

This project is still in early development stage. It is not ready to use, not even experimentally.
